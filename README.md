As I said in the introduction of this book: 

> This book is a small gift to a younger me, probably in high school or even earlier. This book is by no means written for seasoned researchers or professionals. It should be treated as the first bite of ice cream which makes you want more. 

For various reasons, my point was not reflected in the book marketing, etc. The title proposed was `scientific simlation for the curious young`, which in my opinion reflects the authors' intention much more accurately. With the original intention, the content sacrifices some *respect for scientific progress* for easiness to understand, keeps code reduandancy so it is easier to follow. This book is not written for Python experts or researchers. I apologize again if the title misleads you. I hope you find this page before you made the purchasing decision.

For the bad code formatting in the book, I apologize too. There isn't much I can do except to keep each line shorter if possible. Please find the formatted, tested code in this repository. 

If you had any additional questions, feel free to create an issue or contact me directly. Thanks!
